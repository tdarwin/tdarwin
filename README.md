### Hi there, I'm Davin ðŸ‘‹  (he/him)

I currently work for [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io) as a Customer Architect.  Helping customers with DevOps and the usefulness of Observability applied to all aspects of your development projects.

I'm also working on my own time on a startup project called [Enchantment](https://enchantment.io) which is essentially aimed at being a think-tank/foundry for my interesting startup/app/product ideas.  I've got plenty of ideas, and I'm finally getting comfortable enough with coding that I'm able to start putting some things together.  

While I'm putting things together, I'm also trying to stream my work even if my repos aren't public. You can catch me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/tdarwin) from time to time as I beat my head against my desk trying to learn Go and Python and Kubernetes and Microservices Architectures and all that fun.

If you're interested in collaborating with me, feel free to send a message here on github, or there's contact info on [my website](https://davintaddeo.com).
